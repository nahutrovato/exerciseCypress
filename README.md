## This is Cypress project for a QA Automation challenge

- This project is an Cypress automation framework
- Only for a challenge purposes


## Solution

- I used the library Mocha and Chai to development the exercise
- Page Object Model is the design pattern that I used to reduce code duplication and improves test case maintenance  

## Installation

Cypress requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the Cypress runner.

```sh
npm install
```
After that you can open the project
```sh
npx cypress open
```

## Plugins

I don't use any plugin to run these test.
